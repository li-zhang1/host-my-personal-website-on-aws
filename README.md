# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code and assets for my personal portfolio website. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site is hosted on AWS utilizing Amazon S3 and Route 53 for seamless scalability and reliability.

## Deploying the Website on Amazon S3

### 1. Domain Registration and S3 Setup

- Register a custom domain through Route 53.
- Create an S3 bucket with a name matching the domain.

### 2. Configuring the S3 Bucket

- Disable "Block all public access."
- Upload website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Enable static website hosting.
- Set `index.html` as the default entry point.

### 3. Setting Up a Public Access Policy

To grant public read access, apply the following policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Sid": "PublicReadAccess",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::yourdomain.com/*"
  }]
}
```

### 4. Configuring Route 53 for Domain Routing

- Create a new record in the hosted zone.
- Enable Alias routing.
- Point the record to the S3 website endpoint (US East N. Virginia).
- Use a Simple routing policy for efficient domain resolution.

### 5. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy your GitHub repository to an AWS S3 bucket

- Set Up OIDC Authentication for GitHub Actions
    - Create an IAM Role for GitHub Actions
    - Attach an S3 Access Policy
    - Add a Trust Policy for GitHub
- Use IAM Role in GitHub Actions Workflow

#### âœ… Benefits of Using OIDC for GitHub Actions

âœ” **No long-term AWS access keys** stored in GitHub.  
âœ” **More secure** than hardcoded credentials.  
âœ” **GitHub Actions dynamically assumes the IAM role** when needed.  
âœ” **Follows AWS security best practices** (least privilege principle).


## Technologies Used

- **Amazon S3**: Secure, scalable object storage for static website hosting.
- **Route 53**: A robust DNS service ensuring efficient domain name management.
- **HTML**: Defines the websiteâ€™s structure and content.
- **CSS**: Enhances styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implements interactive and dynamic functionalities.


# Continuous Improvement

### Add a Contact Form with AWS Lambda & API Gateway

A contact form aws implemented using AWS services to process and store form submissions. The form allows users to submit messages, which are then processed by an AWS Lambda function via API Gateway. Messages can be stored in Amazon DynamoDB or sent via Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).

### Features
- **API Gateway + Lambda**: Handles and processes form submissions.
- **DynamoDB or SES**: Messages can be stored in DynamoDB or forwarded as emails using SES.
- **Serverless Architecture**: No need to manage servers, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency.

### Services Used
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes form submissions.
- **API Gateway**: Exposes a RESTful endpoint for the form.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Optionally stores form messages.
- **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)**: Sends form submissions as emails.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Deploy API Gateway & Lambda
1. Create a Lambda function to process form submissions.
2. Configure API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function via an HTTP endpoint.

#### 2. Configure SES (Optional)
1. Verify an email address in SES.
2. Set up SES to send emails from the contact form.

#### 3. Configure DynamoDB (Optional)
1. Create a DynamoDB table to store messages.
2. Update the Lambda function to save messages in the table.

### Usage
- Users submit a message through the contact form.
- The API Gateway triggers the Lambda function.
- The Lambda function processes and stores the message in DynamoDB or sends an email via SES.

### ðŸ”§ Future Enhancements
- Implement reCAPTCHA for spam protection.
- Add authentication for API requests.
- Improve error handling and logging.

---
This project provides a scalable, serverless way to handle contact form submissions using AWS services.
